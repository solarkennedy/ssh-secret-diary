# ssh-secret-diary

An experiment in using ssh private/public keys for asymetric file encryption.

Don't use this, it almost certainly doesn't work.

## Usage

    ./ssh-secret-diary some-secret-file

The script will decrypt the file, open it in your EDITOR, then re-encrypt it

## TODO

* Multi-user capability?
